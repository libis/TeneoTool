msg.Md5Help=This tool will calculate the checksums of all files found in a directory.\n\
\n\
If a special file called "checksums" is found, it''s contents will be compared with\n\
the calculated checksums and any discrepancies will be displayed in the results\n\
table. Next to the file name, the results table contains the status of each file with:\n\
\n\
- "OK" : the file''s calculated checksum equals the one stored in the checksums file\
- "CHANGED" : the checksum in the checksums file does not match the calculated checksum\
- "NEW" : there is no entry in the checksums file for this file\
- "DELETED" : there is an entry in the checksums file, but the file does not exist\
- "IGNORED" : the entry in the checksum file is marked as to be ignored\
- "IGNORE" : you have marked the file to be ignored in the future, but the entry in\n\
      the checksums file has not been marked as to be ignored yet\n\
\n\
Under the results table, the application keeps track of the count for each status.\n\
\n\
When the files'' checksums are calculated and compared with the checksums in the checksums file,\n\
the button on the bottow will color red or green, depending on the status of the files\n\
compared to the checksums file. If they match - i.o.w. all statuses are either "OK" or "IGNORED",\n\
the checksums match and the button will be green. Clicking on the green button will\n\
recalculate the checksums. If the checksums do not match, the button will be red and\n\
clicking on the red button will save the new checksums and states to the checksum file.
